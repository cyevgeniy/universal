The Universal Theme is a theme and  starter template for
[11ty static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/).
It's planned to add support for Hugo, Jekyll and other SSG when a version
for 11ty will be finished.

**Good news**! While Universal is still in development, it's quite
usable, so **[check it out](https://github.com/cyevgeniy/universal)**.
