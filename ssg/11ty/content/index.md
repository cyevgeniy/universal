Universal is a theme and  a starter template for [11ty static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/).
It's planned to add support for Hugo, Jekyll and other SSG when a version
for 11ty will be finished.

**Good news**! While Universal is still in development, it's quite
usable, so **[check it out](https://github.com/cyevgeniy/universal)**.

	##  Goals

	- Blazingly fast. Site with Universal **loads in a moment**
	- Includes useful and eye-catching shortcodes. **Full-screen bleeds,
	  cards, card grids, in-paragraph blocks** will help you in fight for
	  **user attention**
	- Example based documentation to help you build **your site** as fast as possible
	- Clean UI
	- Multiple color variations, so you can **choose the tone** you'll speak to your visitors
