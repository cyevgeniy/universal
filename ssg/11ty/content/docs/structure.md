title: Directories structure
---

The directory structure is pretty simple.

**_data** directory has only one file named `meta.js`.
This file contains global settings, such as site title and
how much posts is shown on the `/blog` page.

**_includes** directory contains templates that describe html
markup for your site.

**content** directory is where your content lives. Blog posts,
about pages, everything is here.

**img** directory is for all your images.

**public** directory contains minified CSS.
