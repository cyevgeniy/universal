title: Directory structure
---

The directory structure is pretty simple.

**_data** directory has only one file named `meta.js`.
This file contains global settings, such as site title and
how much posts is shown on the `/blog` page.

**_includes** directory contains templates that describe html
markup for your site.

**content** directory contains content of your site. This is the
place where you should create new files. We'll talk about its
internals later.

**public** directory contains minified CSS.
