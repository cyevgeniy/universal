title: Quote shortcode
---

Use quote shortcode to highlight most important
parts of your content.

{% raw %}
```
{% quote "Quote text" %}
```
{% endraw %}

Quote text is centered, so it's better to not use
large text.

{% quote "It's better to use short sentences as quote text" %}

It's also better when a quote is wrapped with text from the both
sides, so don't put them at the bottom or at the beginning of text.
